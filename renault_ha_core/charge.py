"""Charge-session reconciliation shared by the Renault-platform add-ons.

Two sources feed the "Last Charge" sensors and this module reconciles them:
  * update_charge_session() *infers* a session by watching live battery polls (works on every
    car, but its end time is when we first observed charging==false);
  * resolve_last_charge() reads Renault's own authoritative per-session record via the charges
    endpoint (when the car exposes it) and prefers it, falling back to the inferred value.

Depends only on the util leaf (now_ts/iso/_num) — no per-model variation: the reconciliation
maths and the Kamereon charges-endpoint name are identical across models, so this is a straight
shared lift. The add-on's poll loop imports update_charge_session + resolve_last_charge (and
CHARGES_ENDPOINT, for its endpoint-support probe).
