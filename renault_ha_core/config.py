"""Config reading + secret-redaction primitives shared by the Renault-platform add-ons.

A leaf seam: it imports nothing else in the package, so every other module (main, debug, mqtt,
charge) can depend on it without an import cycle. It holds add-on option reading (`cfg`,
`_opt_flag`) and the secret-redaction net (`redact` / `_RedactingFilter` / `_config_secrets`)
plus the auto-discovered account id those mask.

The only per-model variation is the environment-variable prefix the add-on exports its options
under (`A290_` for the Alpine A290, `R5_` for the Renault 5). The add-on injects it by setting
``config.ENV_PREFIX`` at startup (from its ``catalog.ENV_PREFIX``) — everything else here is
identical between models. `_config_secrets` reads the prefixed names lazily, so the prefix only
has to be set before the first redaction (the add-on wires it at import time).
